# Engineering log

Real problems, real fixes. Written as they happen, not reconstructed afterwards.

The Razorpay application form asks "what broke, and how you got out" — and says it's
the answer they read first. This file is the raw material for that answer. Rules for
myself: log the embarrassing ones, log the dead ends, and never smooth over a bug I
didn't actually understand.

Format for each entry:

```
## [Day N] One-line symptom
**Symptom:** what I actually observed
**First hypothesis:** what I thought it was, and why that was wrong
**Root cause:** what it actually was
**Fix:** what I changed
**Lesson:** the generalisable thing I now know
```

## [Day 0] Decided against a monorepo after starting one

**Symptom:** Not a bug — a design reversal worth recording. I began scaffolding this as
an npm-workspaces monorepo with five packages.

**First hypothesis:** Clean package boundaries would keep the agent from accidentally
reading simulator internals, which is the one architectural property this project
genuinely needs (see `docs/honesty.md`).

**Root cause of the reversal:** Workspace tooling overhead is real, and I'm solo with a
13-day budget. The boundary I care about is "the agent must not be able to read ground
truth," and I realised I could enforce that far more cheaply: keep latent simulator
truth in a **separate Mongo collection** that the agent code never imports a model for.
The guarantee comes from the data layer, not from the build system.

**Fix:** Single Node package, plain directories under `src/`. One test asserts the agent
never imports the latent-truth model.

**Lesson:** Pick the cheapest mechanism that actually enforces the invariant you care
about. I was reaching for package boundaries out of habit when a collection boundary was
stronger *and* free — package boundaries are a convention a tired developer can violate
at 2am, whereas the agent simply has no code path to the data.

## [Day 2] My fatigue curve was backwards, and it was backwards in my own favour

**Symptom:** 25 of 26 simulator invariants passed on the first run. The one failure was
the check that the 4th message to a customer hurts more than the 2nd:

```
FAIL  the drop is convex (4th touch hurts more than the 2nd)
      d1=0.1399 d3=0.0838
```

**First hypothesis:** A bad assertion. I'd written the test from the docstring and assumed
I'd just got a comparison operator the wrong way round at midnight.

**Root cause:** The test was right and the model was wrong. I had written

```js
const remaining = (budget - touchesUsed) / budget;
const fatigue = Math.pow(remaining, A.fatigueExponent);  // exponent 1.6
```

and documented it as *"above 1.0 means fatigue accelerates."* It does the opposite.
Raising *remaining* patience to a power above 1 makes the multiplier fall in shrinking
steps — with a budget of 4 the series is 1 → 0.63 → 0.33 → 0.11 → 0, so the per-touch
damage is 0.37, 0.30, 0.22, 0.11. The **first** message was the expensive one and the
fourth was nearly free.

The uncomfortable part is the direction of the error. Fatigue that gets cheaper per
message quietly rewards volume, which means my simulator was tilted toward the
aggressive baseline I intend to beat — I had accidentally handicapped *myself*. Had the
bug leaned the other way I might never have questioned a passing test.

**Fix:** Reparameterised on patience *spent*, so the constant's name matches its
behaviour: `fatigue = 1 - (touchesUsed / budget) ** exponent`. Now >1 accelerates, =1 is
linear, <1 decelerates. Added an invariant asserting the curvature actually flips when
the exponent crosses 1.0, so the parameter can't drift away from its own name again.

Then a second, worse problem surfaced while fixing the first. Each assumption carries a
declared `sweep` range for the sensitivity analysis, and `fatigueExponent` declares
`[0.6, 2.6]` — deliberately spanning the regime where my policy's main advantage
disappears. But `perturbAssumptions` ignored those ranges and applied a flat ±30%
jitter, which around 1.6 explores only **1.12–2.08**. The sweep could never reach below
1.0. My documentation promised to test the assumption most likely to embarrass me, and
the code structurally could not do it. Nothing failed; the numbers would have looked
fine.

Rewrote the perturbation to sample from each leaf's own declared range (applied as a
ratio, so overrides still compose), and added three guards: that the full sweep reaches
below 1.0, that it reaches above 2.0, and that samples stay inside the declared band.

**Lesson:** Two things I'll carry forward. First, when a test contradicts a comment, find
out which is lying before you touch either — the comment was the bug both times here.
Second, and the one I actually care about: check which way your bugs lean. An honest
sensitivity analysis has to be *able* to produce the result you don't want, and "we swept
±30%" sounds rigorous while guaranteeing nothing about what was covered. Ranges in a
docstring that no code reads are decoration. Wire the documentation to the executable, or
assume it's false.

## [Day 2] No database, no package registry — and it made the architecture better

**Symptom:** Went to install dependencies and load the seeded world into MongoDB. Neither
was available: `npm ping` returned `403 Forbidden` from the registry, and there was no
`mongod` on the machine. I could run nothing but dependency-free Node.

**First hypothesis:** A blocker to route around — get Mongo running, then continue. I
started thinking about how much of the plan to defer until I had it.

**Root cause of the reversal:** It isn't a blocker, it's a constraint that exposed a design
flaw I'd have shipped otherwise. My plan had every component writing through mongoose
models, which would have meant three things I didn't want:

1. The sensitivity sweep replays the whole batch under many perturbed assumption sets
   across five policy arms — thousands of runs. Round-tripping every decision through a
   database turns a two-minute analysis into an hour-long one, and an analysis that takes
   an hour is an analysis I quietly stop running.
2. A reviewer cloning the repo would need to stand up MongoDB before reproducing a single
   number. That is an excellent way to ensure nobody reproduces any of them.
3. I couldn't test the thing I was writing, which is how untested code acquires the
   confidence of tested code.

**Fix:** Persistence is now a seam. `src/db/store.js` defines a narrow, domain-specific
interface with an in-memory implementation; the eval uses it by default, so `npm run eval`
works on a clean clone with nothing but Node. Mongo becomes a second implementation behind
the same interface, used by the API and dashboard where a persisted, queryable audit trail
is a real requirement — "show an audit trail" is one of four things Track 03 asks for, and
one that vanishes on process exit isn't one.

The interface names ~15 real access patterns rather than exposing a generic
`find(mongoQuery)`. I considered the generic wrapper and rejected it: it would force the
in-memory store to reimplement Mongo's query semantics, and every gap between the two
becomes a bug that appears in exactly one of them. The likely victim is
`countContactsSince`, which enforces the per-customer messaging cap — a subtly different
date comparison between stores means the guardrail holds in evaluation and leaks in
production. That's the worst possible place to put a portability bug.

Both implementations run the *same* assertions, in `test/storeContract.js`. The in-memory
one passes 13 of them now; the Mongo one has to pass all 13 before I trust a number that
came out of it.

Also seeded worlds to committed JSON instead of straight to the database, with observable
world and latent truth in separate files mirroring the collection split. Re-seeding is
byte-identical, verified.

**Lesson:** When the environment takes a tool away, check whether the tool was load-bearing
or just familiar. I reached for Mongo everywhere because the project is nominally MERN, not
because the eval needed a database — and "MERN" described my habits rather than this
program's requirements. The constraint also handed me a property I wanted anyway and would
not have prioritised: one command, no infrastructure, reproduces the headline numbers.
